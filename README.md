# p4pdes-next

This repository contains codes which might (hypothetically) go in the 2nd edition of [PETSc for PDEs](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes).  Actually, it is more fair to say that these codes are just PETSc-using examples and explorations.  As with [PETSc for PDEs](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes), some codes are in C and some, which use [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), are in Python.

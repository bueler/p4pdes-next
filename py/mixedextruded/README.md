==============

This is me fiddling around.  The example `mixedpoisson.py` is from section 3.1 of Gibson et al 2019, and `extruded.py` is from section 3.2 and 3.3 of the same work.  There is no reason to use these codes because it is better to download/fork  https://github.com/thomasgibson/firedrake-springerbrief-examples
